The Library has 1864, 1865, and 1866 editions of the Key to Bachelder's Isometrical Drawing of the Gettysburg Battle-field, with a Brief Description of the Battle. This 10- or 12-page work, published in New York by C. A. Alvord, apparently was intended to accompany the print. Overprinted with a grid. It accompanies Bachelder's Gettysburg: What to See, and How to see It. The detailed index of this work lists the various units of the armies and gives the grid coordinates of each. It was issued in many editions of which the library has the 1873 edition and the tenth edition, 1890. Description derived from published bibliography. Available also through the Library of Congress web site as raster image."

In his report to the Superintendent of the Coast survey dated November 1, 1862, Nicholson notes that ""In addition to the printing of our charts proper, a map representing the seat of war in Virginia was, at the suggestion of the Superintendent, compiled by myself during the past year, and printed in colors, partly as an experiment in that class of work, and partly to meet the popular demand for information on the movements of our armies. This map has met with unexpected success, and has been much called for, and copies quite freely distributed; but, in order to cover the expenses of its getting up and printing, a number of copies have been placed in the hands of our sale agents, the proceeds of which have more than covered expenses; in all, some five thousand five hundred copies have been printed, over twenty-five hundred sold, and nearly three thousand copies gratuitously distributed.""
